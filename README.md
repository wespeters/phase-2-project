# MovieScope

## Pitch

MovieScope is an interactive app where users can access information about a collection of movies and view crowd-sourced ratings and reviews. Users can participate by sharing their own opinions, and adding/deleting movies from the collection. 

## Wireframe

## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to view a movie card (or possibly a list of all movies) including a poster, review and rating upon loading the home page (GET). I want to be able to filter the movies displayed on the home page by searching movies by title. Clicking on one a movie card will bring up the page for the clicked movie (GET). Clicking ‘Edit/Update’ will open a form to edit that movie’s info (GET). Submitting that form will update the info and re-render the page with the update (PUT/PATCH). I want to click a link to navigate to a form where I can add a new movie to the database (POST). I also want to be able to delete a movie from the database (DELETE).

## React App Info

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
